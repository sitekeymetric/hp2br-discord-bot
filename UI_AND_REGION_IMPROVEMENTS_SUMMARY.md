# UI Improvements & Region-Based Team Balancing (v1.7.0)

## Overview
Implemented major UI improvements by removing the "End Game" button from team creation and adding it to match results, plus added comprehensive region-based team balancing functionality to `/create_teams`.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. üéÆ **UI Improvements**

#### Removed "End Game" Button from Team Creation
- **Before**: Team proposal had both "Create Team" and "End Game" buttons
- **After**: Team proposal has only "Create Team" button
- **Issue Fixed**: "End Game" button was disabled when "Create Team" was clicked, preventing users from accessing it

#### Added "End Game" Button to Match Results
- **Location**: Now appears in the match result recording dialogue (`/record_result`)
- **Functionality**: Allows users to end the game without recording results
- **Post-Match Cleanup**: Also appears after match results are recorded for final cleanup

#### Enhanced Button Behavior
- **Single Button Disable**: Only the clicked button is disabled initially, not all buttons
- **User Action Logging**: All button clicks are logged to stdout for better tracking
- **Improved Feedback**: Clear user feedback for all button interactions

### 2. üåç **Region-Based Team Balancing**

#### New `/create_teams` Parameter
```bash
/create_teams region:CA  # Ensures each team has at least one CA player
/create_teams num_teams:2 region:TX  # 2 teams, each with at least one TX player
```

#### Supported Regions
- **CA** - California
- **TX** - Texas  
- **NY** - New York
- **KR** - Korea
- **NA** - North America
- **EU** - Europe

#### Region Requirement Logic
- **Validation**: Checks if enough regional players exist before team creation
- **Distribution**: Ensures each team gets at least one player from the specified region
- **Balancing**: Maintains skill balance while satisfying region requirements
- **Fallback**: Clear error messages when requirements cannot be met

### 3. üîß **Technical Implementation**

#### Enhanced Team Balancer
- **`_create_balanced_teams_with_region()`**: New method for region-based balancing
- **`_split_five_players()`**: Updated to support region requirements for 5-player matches
- **`_distribute_players_snake_draft()`**: Helper method for distributing players with snake draft

#### Smart Region Distribution
```python
# For 6+ players with region requirement:
1. Separate players by region (regional vs non-regional)
2. Distribute one regional player to each team first
3. Use snake draft for remaining regional players
4. Use snake draft for non-regional players
```

#### Special Case Handling
- **Single Team (1-4 players)**: Region requirement noted but not enforced
- **Two Teams (5 players)**: Smart 2:3 split with regional player distribution
- **Multiple Teams (6+ players)**: Full region-based balancing algorithm

### 4. üé® **Enhanced User Interface**

#### Team Proposal Display
- **Region Indicators**: Shows player regions in team proposals
- **Regional Highlighting**: Players from required region marked with üåç
- **Clear Requirements**: Displays region requirement in embed description
- **Informative Footer**: Explains region requirement and player distribution

#### Error Handling
- **No Regional Players**: Clear message when no players from required region exist
- **Insufficient Players**: Warns when not enough regional players for team count
- **Requirement Not Met**: Shows which teams lack regional players after balancing

#### Visual Enhancements
```
üéÆ Team Proposal
üåç Region Requirement: Each team has at least one CA player

üî¥ Team 1 (Avg: 1520)
‚Ä¢ Player1 (1600) [CA] üåç
‚Ä¢ Player2 (1450) [TX]
‚Ä¢ Player3 (1510) [NY]

üîµ Team 2 (Avg: 1505)  
‚Ä¢ Player4 (1580) [CA] üåç
‚Ä¢ Player5 (1420) [EU]
‚Ä¢ Player6 (1515) [KR]
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Team Creation (No Changes)
```bash
/create_teams                    # Auto-balanced teams
/create_teams num_teams:2        # 2 balanced teams
```

### Region-Based Team Creation (New)
```bash
/create_teams region:CA          # Each team has ‚â•1 CA player
/create_teams num_teams:3 region:TX  # 3 teams, each with ‚â•1 TX player
/create_teams region:KR          # Each team has ‚â•1 KR player
```

### Match Result Workflow (Improved)
```bash
1. /create_teams region:CA       # Create teams with CA requirement
2. [Players click "Create Team"] # Teams created, players moved
3. [Match is played]
4. /record_result               # Interactive result recording
5. [Select win/loss/draw for each team]
6. [Click "Submit Results" OR "End Game"]
7. [If results submitted, "End Game" button appears for cleanup]
```

## Benefits

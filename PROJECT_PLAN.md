# 🎯 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## MVP Goal
Create balanced teams from "Waiting Room" voice channel participants, display team proposals, and track basic results.

## MVP User Flow
1. Players join "Waiting Room" voice channel
2. Admin runs `/create_teams` command
3. Bot analyzes players and creates balanced teams
4. Bot presents team proposal with Accept/Decline buttons
5. On acceptance, players are moved to team voice channels
6. Admin records match results
7. Player ratings are updated

## MVP Phase 3: Team Balancing
**Duration**: 2 days | **Priority**: Critical | **Component**: Both

### MVP Balancing Algorithm
```python
def create_balanced_teams(players):
    # Enhanced algorithm with special cases
    if len(players) <= 4:
        # Single team for practice/warmup
        return [players]
    elif len(players) == 5:
        # 2:3 split (top 2 vs bottom 3)
        return split_five_players(players)
    else:
        # Normal snake draft for 6+ players
        sorted_players = sort_by_rating(players)
        teams = distribute_snake_draft(sorted_players, num_teams=3)
        return teams
```

### MVP Balance Logic
- **Special Cases**: 
  - 1-4 players: Single team (no balancing needed)
  - 5 players: 2:3 split by rating (top 2 vs bottom 3)
- **Normal Cases (6+ players)**: Snake draft by rating (highest→lowest→lowest→highest)
- **Teams**: Auto-determined based on player count
- **Fallback**: Random distribution if ratings similar

### MVP Team Display
- Show teams with player names and ratings
- Calculate team average rating
- Simple "Team 1", "Team 2", "Team 3" naming

**MVP Deliverable**: Working team generation with basic balancing

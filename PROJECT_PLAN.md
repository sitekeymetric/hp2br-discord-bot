# Discord Team Balance Bot - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A Discord.py bot system that creates balanced teams for competitive gameplay using skill ratings, with database persistence and API layer for multi-guild support.

## Architecture
- **Component 1**: Discord Bot (Python with discord.py)
- **Component 2**: Database API (FastAPI/Flask REST service)

---

# üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## MVP Goal
Create balanced teams from "Waiting Room" voice channel participants, display team proposals, and track basic results.

## MVP User Flow
1. Players join "Waiting Room" voice channel
2. Admin runs `/create_teams` command
3. Bot analyzes players and creates balanced teams
4. Bot presents team proposal with Accept/Decline buttons
5. On acceptance, players are moved to team voice channels
6. Admin records match results
7. Player ratings are updated

## MVP Phase 2: Basic Discord Bot
**Duration**: 2 days | **Priority**: Critical | **Component**: Discord Bot

### MVP Bot Features
- `/register [region]` - Register user in system with optional region
- `/set_region <region_code>` - Update user's region (NA, EU, AS, etc.)

## MVP Phase 3: Team Balancing
**Duration**: 2 days | **Priority**: Critical | **Component**: Both

### MVP Balancing Algorithm
```python
def create_balanced_teams(players):
    # Simple algorithm for MVP
    sorted_players = sort_by_rating(players)
    teams = distribute_snake_draft(sorted_players, num_teams=3)
    return teams
```

### MVP Balance Logic
- **Primary**: Snake draft by rating (highest‚Üílowest‚Üílowest‚Üíhighest)
- **Teams**: 3-5 teams of 3-4 players each
- **Fallback**: Random distribution if ratings similar

### MVP Team Display
- Show teams with player names and ratings
- Calculate team average rating
- Simple "Team 1", "Team 2", "Team 3" naming

**MVP Deliverable**: Working team generation with basic balancing

---

## MVP Phase 4: User Interface
**Duration**: 2 days | **Priority**: Critical | **Component**: Discord Bot

### MVP Team Proposal
```
üéÆ **Team Proposal** üéÆ
**Team 1** (Avg: 1520)
‚Ä¢ Player1 (1600)
‚Ä¢ Player2 (1450)
‚Ä¢ Player3 (1510)

**Team 2** (Avg: 1505)

- Move players to their assigned team channels
- Basic cleanup after match ends

### MVP Session Management
- Track active matches
- `/end_match` command to cleanup channels

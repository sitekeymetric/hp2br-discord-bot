1st Place: Always +25 rating
20th Place: Always -22.6 rating
```

### **After v3.0.0 (Advanced Skill-Based System)**
```
Dynamic rating changes based on multiple factors:

## 🎯 Opponent Strength Multiplier System

### **Strength Difference Calculation**
```python
strength_diff = avg_opponent_rating - your_team_rating

Examples:
Your team: 1500, Opponents avg: 1800 → +300 (much stronger)
Your team: 1600, Opponents avg: 1400 → -200 (weaker)
```

### **Multiplier Table**
```
💪 Facing Stronger Opponents (Bonus Rewards/Protection)
+500+ difference: ×2.2 multiplier (Extreme underdogs)
+300+ difference: ×1.8 multiplier (Major underdogs)
+150+ difference: ×1.4 multiplier (Underdogs)
+50+ difference:  ×1.2 multiplier (Slight underdogs)

⚖️ Similar Strength
±50 difference:   ×1.0 multiplier (Fair match)

📉 Facing Weaker Opponents (Reduced Rewards/Harsher Penalties)
-50+ difference:  ×0.8 multiplier (Slight favorites)
-150+ difference: ×0.6 multiplier (Favorites)
-300+ difference: ×0.4 multiplier (Heavy favorites)
-500+ difference: ×0.2 multiplier (Extreme favorites)
```

## 📈 Rating Curve System (Anti-Inflation)

### **Climbing Multipliers (Positive Changes)**
```
🏆 Elite Tier (2000+):     ×0.3 (Very slow climbing)
🥇 Expert Tier (1800+):    ×0.5 (Slow climbing)
🥈 Advanced Tier (1600+):  ×0.7 (Moderate climbing)
🥉 Intermediate (1400+):   ×0.85 (Slightly reduced)
📊 Below Average (<1400):  ×1.0 (Normal climbing)
```

### **Dropping Multipliers (Negative Changes)**
```
🏆 Elite Tier (2000+):     ×1.5 (Faster drops)
🥇 Expert Tier (1800+):    ×1.3 (Faster drops)
🥈 Advanced Tier (1600+):  ×1.1 (Slightly faster)
📊 Lower Tiers (<1600):    ×1.0 (Normal drops)
```

## 🧮 Complete Rating Formula

```python
def calculate_advanced_rating_change(player_rating, team_avg_rating, placement, opponent_teams):
    # Step 1: Base placement score
    base_score = get_placement_score(placement)
    
    # Step 2: Opponent strength multiplier
    opponent_multiplier = calculate_opponent_strength(team_avg_rating, opponent_teams)
    
    # Step 3: Individual skill adjustment
    individual_adjustment = calculate_individual_factor(player_rating, team_avg_rating)
    
    # Step 4: Preliminary change
    preliminary_change = base_score * opponent_multiplier * individual_adjustment
    
    # Step 5: Apply rating curve
    curve_multiplier = get_rating_curve_multiplier(player_rating, preliminary_change)
    
    # Step 6: Final calculation
    final_change = preliminary_change * curve_multiplier
    
    # Step 7: Apply limits (max ±150 or 15% of current rating)
    max_change = min(150, player_rating * 0.15)
    return clamp(final_change, -max_change, max_change)
```

## 📊 Real-World Examples

### **Example 1: Underdog Victory**
```
Player: 1200 rating
Team Average: 1150 rating  
Opponents: Team A (1600), Team B (1500)
Result: 1st place

Calculation:
Base Score: +50 (1st place)
Opponent Strength: avg(1600,1500) = 1550 vs 1150 = +400 difference
Opponent Multiplier: ×1.8 (major underdogs)
Individual Adjustment: ×1.0 (similar to team)
Rating Curve: ×1.0 (below 1400, normal climbing)

Final Change: 50 × 1.8 × 1.0 × 1.0 = +90 points
New Rating: 1200 → 1290 (Huge underdog bonus!)
```

### **Example 2: Expected Elite Performance**
```
Player: 2100 rating (Elite)
Team Average: 2000 rating
Opponents: Team A (1800), Team B (1900)
Result: 1st place

Calculation:
Base Score: +50 (1st place)
Opponent Strength: avg(1800,1900) = 1850 vs 2000 = -150 difference  
Opponent Multiplier: ×0.6 (facing weaker opponents)
Individual Adjustment: ×1.0 (similar to team)
Rating Curve: ×0.3 (elite climbing penalty)

Final Change: 50 × 0.6 × 1.0 × 0.3 = +9 points
New Rating: 2100 → 2109 (Very slow elite progress)
```

### **Example 3: Elite Player Disaster**
```
Player: 2000 rating (Elite)
Team Average: 1950 rating
Opponents: Similar strength teams
Result: 25th place

Calculation:
Base Score: -220 (25th place)
Opponent Multiplier: ×1.0 (similar opponents)
Individual Adjustment: ×1.0 (similar to team)
Rating Curve: ×1.5 (faster elite drops)

Final Change: -220 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.5 = -330 points
New Rating: 2000 → 1670 (Massive drop!)
```

### **Example 4: Your Original Scenario**
```
Player: 1600 rating
Team Average: 1500 rating
Opponents: Team A (1200), Team B (1500)
Result: 1st place

Calculation:
Base Score: +50 (1st place)
Opponent Strength: avg(1200,1500) = 1350 vs 1500 = -150 difference
Opponent Multiplier: ×0.6 (facing weaker opponents)
Individual Adjustment: ×1.1 (above team average)
Rating Curve: ×0.7 (advanced tier climbing penalty)

Final Change: 50 × 0.6 × 1.1 × 0.7 = +23.1 points
New Rating: 1600 → 1623.1 (Reasonable climb)
```

## 🎯 Benefits of New System

### **For Players**
- **Fair Competition**: Opponent strength matters
- **Skill Recognition**: Individual performance vs team average
- **Meaningful Progression**: Harder to climb at higher levels
- **Significant Consequences**: Bad performances have real impact

### **For Competitive Integrity**
- **Prevents Rating Inflation**: Curved scaling system
- **Rewards Upsets**: Beating stronger opponents = big rewards
- **Punishes Poor Performance**: Especially at higher ratings
- **Encourages Consistent Play**: Single bad game can hurt significantly

### **For System Health**
- **Natural Rating Distribution**: Players settle at appropriate levels
- **Long-term Engagement**: Takes significant effort to reach elite
- **Skill-based Matchmaking**: More accurate rating representation
- **Anti-boosting**: Harder to manipulate ratings

# Discord Bot Implementation Plan
## Discord Team Balance Bot - Component 2

---

## 🎯 Implementation Overview

**Goal**: Build a Discord.py bot that integrates with the FastAPI database to provide team balancing functionality

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Timeline**: Originally 2-3 days - **Completed in 1 day**
**Component**: Discord Bot (Component 2 of 2)

**Prerequisites**: 
- ✅ Database API running and accessible
- ✅ All API endpoints tested and functional
- ✅ Rating system ready for integration

---

## 🔧 Version Management System

### Automatic Versioning
- Centralized version management with `VERSION.json`
- Automatic changelog generation in `CHANGES.md`
- Version display in bot startup and commands
- Semantic versioning: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-build.{build}`

### Version Update Process
```bash
# Update version (most common)
python3 update_version.py minor "Description of changes"

# Show current version
python3 version.py show
```

### Version Display Locations
- Bot startup console output
- `/help` command embed field
- `/guild_stats` admin command
- API startup and endpoints (`/version`, `/health`)

## 🎮 Voice Channel Management

### Voice Channel Structure
```
Guild Voice Channels:
├── Waiting Room          # Players gather here (any number 1+)
├── 🔴 Team 1 Voice          # Auto-created team channels
├── 🔵 Team 2 Voice          # Auto-created team channels (if 2+ teams)
├── 🟢 Team 3 Voice          # Auto-created team channels (if 3+ teams)
├── 🟡 Team 4 Voice          # Auto-created team channels (if 4+ teams)
├── 🟠 Team 5 Voice          # Auto-created team channels (if 5+ teams)
└── 🟣 Team 6 Voice          # Auto-created team channels (if 6 teams)
```

### Flexible Team Channel Creation
The bot adapts voice channel creation based on player count:

- **1-4 players**: Creates single "🔴 Team 1 Voice" channel
- **5 players**: Creates "🔴 Team 1 Voice" (2 players) and "🔵 Team 2 Voice" (3 players)
- **6+ players**: Creates appropriate number of team channels for balanced teams

### Voice Management Features
```python
class VoiceManager:
    async def get_waiting_room_members(self, guild) -> List[discord.Member]:
        """Get all members in waiting room voice channel (no minimum required)"""
        # IMPORTANT: Uses exact name matching for "Waiting Room" channel
        # Changed from substring matching to prevent false matches
        
    async def create_team_channels(self, guild, team_config: dict) -> List[discord.VoiceChannel]:
        """
        Create temporary team voice channels based on configuration
        - Handles single team, asymmetric teams, and balanced teams
        - Names channels appropriately for each scenario
        """
        
    async def move_players_to_teams(self, teams: List[List[discord.Member]], team_config: dict):
        """
        Move players to their assigned team channels
        - Single team: All players to Team 1
        - Multiple teams: Players distributed according to balance
        """
        
    async def cleanup_team_channels(self, guild):
        """Remove temporary team channels and return players to waiting room"""
        
    async def setup_voice_channels(self, guild):
        """Initial setup of required voice channels"""
        
    async def validate_voice_setup(self, guild) -> Tuple[bool, str]:

        - Ensures Waiting Room exists
        - No minimum player requirement
        - Returns validation status and error message if any
        """

## 🔗 API Integration Layer

### HTTP Client Service
```python
class APIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession()

        """GET /matches/user/{guild_id}/{user_id}/history - Get match history"""
```

## ⚖️ Team Balancing Algorithm

### Flexible Player Count Handling
The bot now supports ANY number of players with intelligent team creation:

#### Player Count Scenarios:
- **1-4 players**: Single team configuration
  - All players placed in one team voice channel
  - No competitive balancing needed
  - Useful for practice, casual play, or waiting for more players
  
- **5 players**: Suboptimal 2v3 configuration
  - Creates 2 teams: Team 1 (2 players) vs Team 2 (3 players)
  - Bot warns this is suboptimal but functional
  - Balances by putting stronger players on smaller team
  
- **6+ players**: Optimal balanced teams (recommended)
  - Creates 2-6 teams based on player count
  - Uses advanced balancing algorithms
  - Provides best competitive experience

### Balancing Strategy
```python
class TeamBalancer:
    def __init__(self, api_client: APIClient):
        self.api_client = api_client
    
    async def create_balanced_teams(self, members: List[discord.Member], num_teams: int = None) -> List[List[discord.Member]]:

           - 1-4 players: Single team
           - 5 players: 2v3 with balance compensation

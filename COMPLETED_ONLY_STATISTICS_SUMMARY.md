# COMPLETED-Only Statistics Implementation (v1.6.0)

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive changes to ensure all skill ratings, match history, and statistics are based exclusively on COMPLETED matches. Added automatic cleanup of pending matches for involved players during result recording to prevent multiple pending matches per player.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. 🗄️ **Database API Enhancements**

#### New MatchService Methods
- **`get_guild_completed_matches()`**: Returns only completed matches for a guild
- **`get_user_completed_match_history()`**: Returns only completed match history for users
- **`cleanup_pending_matches_for_players()`**: Cleans up pending matches for specific players during result recording

#### New UserService Methods
- **`get_guild_users_with_completed_stats()`**: Returns users with statistics calculated from completed matches only
- **`get_user_with_completed_stats()`**: Returns individual user with completed-only statistics

#### Enhanced Match Result Recording
- **Automatic Cleanup**: When recording results, automatically cancels any other pending matches for involved players
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents players from having multiple pending matches simultaneously
- **Completed-Only Focus**: All rating calculations based exclusively on completed matches

### 2. 🔗 **API Routes Updates**

#### New Endpoints
- **`GET /matches/{guild_id}/completed`**: Get only completed matches for a guild
- **`GET /matches/user/{guild_id}/{user_id}/completed`**: Get user's completed match history
- **`GET /users/{guild_id}/completed-stats`**: Get all users with completed-only statistics
- **`GET /users/{guild_id}/{user_id}/completed-stats`**: Get specific user with completed-only statistics

#### Enhanced Result Recording
- **`PUT /matches/{match_id}/result`**: Now includes automatic cleanup of pending matches for involved players
- **Response Enhancement**: Returns cleanup information in API response

### 3. 🤖 **Discord Bot Updates**

#### Updated Commands (All Now Use COMPLETED-Only Data)
- **`/stats`**: Shows statistics based only on completed matches
- **`/leaderboard`**: Rankings based only on completed matches
- **`/match_history`**: Shows only completed match history
- **`/guild_stats`**: Admin statistics based only on completed matches

#### Enhanced Team Balancing
- **Rating Calculations**: Team balancer now uses completed-only statistics for player ratings
- **Auto-Registration**: New players still get default ratings, but existing players use completed-only stats

#### Updated API Client
- **New Methods**: Added methods to call completed-only API endpoints
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained legacy methods for admin functions that need all data

### 4. 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup System**

#### During Result Recording (`/record_result`)
When a match result is recorded:
1. **Identify Players**: Gets all players involved in the match being completed
2. **Find Pending Matches**: Searches for any other pending matches involving these players
3. **Cancel Pending**: Automatically cancels those pending matches (sets status to CANCELLED)
4. **Complete Current**: Processes the current match result normally
5. **Update Ratings**: Updates player ratings based on the completed match

#### Benefits
- **Prevents Confusion**: Players can't have multiple pending matches
- **Data Cleanliness**: Eliminates abandoned pending matches automatically
- **User Experience**: No need for manual cleanup of old pending matches

## Implementation Details

### Database Strategy
```sql
-- Example: Get completed matches only
SELECT * FROM matches 
WHERE guild_id = ? AND status = 'COMPLETED'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Example: Calculate user stats from completed matches
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as games_played,
  SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'WIN' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'LOSS' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as losses,
  SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'DRAW' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as draws
FROM match_players mp
JOIN matches m ON mp.match_id = m.match_id
WHERE mp.guild_id = ? AND mp.user_id = ? AND m.status = 'COMPLETED';
```

### Automatic Cleanup Logic
```python
def cleanup_pending_matches_for_players(db: Session, player_ids: List[int], guild_id: int) -> int:
    # Find pending matches involving any of these players
    pending_matches = db.query(Match).join(MatchPlayer).filter(
        Match.status == MatchStatus.PENDING,
        Match.guild_id == guild_id,
        MatchPlayer.user_id.in_(player_ids)
    ).distinct().all()
    
    # Cancel each pending match
    for match in pending_matches:
        match.status = MatchStatus.CANCELLED
        match.result_type = ResultType.CANCELLED
        match.end_time = datetime.utcnow()
```

### User Interface Updates
All user-facing commands now include notes about completed-only statistics:
- **Stats Commands**: "Statistics shown are based on completed matches only"
- **Leaderboard**: "Rankings are based on completed matches only"
- **Match History**: "Only completed matches are shown"

## Benefits

### 1. 📊 **Accurate Statistics**
- **True Performance**: Statistics reflect actual completed games only
- **No Inflation**: Pending matches don't artificially inflate game counts
- **Reliable Ratings**: Skill ratings based on real match outcomes

### 2. 🎯 **Better Team Balancing**
- **Accurate Ratings**: Team balancer uses true skill levels from completed matches
- **Fair Teams**: No skewed ratings from abandoned/pending matches
- **Consistent Experience**: All players evaluated on same criteria

### 3. 🧹 **Automatic Data Hygiene**
- **Self-Cleaning**: System automatically prevents multiple pending matches per player
- **No Manual Cleanup**: Administrators don't need to manually clean up old pending matches
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains clean, consistent database state

### 4. 👥 **Improved User Experience**
- **Clear Statistics**: Users see only meaningful, completed match data
- **No Confusion**: Match history shows only actual completed games
- **Reliable Leaderboards**: Rankings based on real performance

## Technical Architecture

### API Layer
```
/users/{guild_id}/completed-stats     → UserService.get_guild_users_with_completed_stats()
/matches/{guild_id}/completed         → MatchService.get_guild_completed_matches()
/matches/{match_id}/result            → Enhanced with automatic cleanup
```

### Bot Layer
```
/stats                               → Uses completed-only API endpoints
/leaderboard                         → Uses completed-only API endpoints
/match_history                       → Uses completed-only API endpoints
/guild_stats                         → Uses completed-only API endpoints
```

### Database Layer
```sql
-- All queries now filter by status = 'COMPLETED'
-- Statistics calculated from completed matches only
-- Automatic cleanup during result recording
```

## Migration Impact

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- **Existing Data**: All existing data preserved
- **Legacy Methods**: Old API methods still available for admin functions
- **Gradual Transition**: System works with both old and new data

### ✅ **No Data Loss**
- **Pending Matches**: Converted to CANCELLED status (preserved for audit)
- **User Data**: All user information maintained
- **Match History**: Complete history preserved, just filtered for display

## Usage Examples

### User Commands (Now COMPLETED-Only)
```bash
# View your completed match statistics
/stats

# View leaderboard based on completed matches
/leaderboard

# View completed match history
/match_history

# Admin: View guild stats from completed matches
/guild_stats
```

### Automatic Cleanup Example
```
Player A and Player B are in a pending match from yesterday.
Today, they complete a new match.

When /record_result is used:
1. System identifies Player A and Player B are involved
2. Finds their old pending match from yesterday
3. Automatically cancels the old pending match
4. Records the new match result
5. Updates their ratings based on the new completed match
```

## Monitoring and Verification

### Statistics Accuracy
- **Before**: Statistics included pending/cancelled matches
- **After**: Statistics based only on completed matches
- **Verification**: Compare game counts - should be lower and more accurate

### Data Cleanliness
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Pending matches automatically cleaned during result recording
- **No Duplicates**: Players can't have multiple pending matches
- **Audit Trail**: Cancelled matches preserved for historical tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Historical Analysis**: Compare completed vs all matches for insights
- **Performance Metrics**: Track cleanup effectiveness
- **Admin Dashboard**: View pending match statistics and cleanup history

### Configuration Options
- **Cleanup Policies**: Configurable cleanup behavior
- **Statistics Display**: Option to show/hide pending match counts
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging of cleanup operations

## Summary

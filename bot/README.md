## Architecture

### Components
- **Main Bot** (`main.py`): Discord connection and command registration
- **Commands**: User, team, and admin command handlers
- **Services**: API client, voice manager, team balancer
- **Utils**: Embed templates, UI components, constants

### Database Integration
- **API Client**: HTTP client for database communication
- **Auto-Registration**: Automatically registers new players
- **Rating System**: Simplified Glicko-2 implementation
- **Match Tracking**: Complete match history and statistics

## Team Balancing Algorithm

### Snake Draft Method
1. **Sort Players**: By rating (skill estimate Œº - uncertainty œÉ/2)
2. **Distribute**: Using snake pattern (1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí3‚Üí2‚Üí1)
3. **Validate**: Ensure fair distribution and team balance
4. **Score**: Calculate balance score (lower = better balance)

### Rating System
- **Initial Rating**: 1500Œº ¬± 350œÉ
- **Updates**: Based on match results (win/loss/draw)
- **Uncertainty**: Decreases with more games played
- **Team Rating**: Average of individual player ratings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot Not Responding**:
   - Check bot token is correct
   - Verify bot has required permissions
   - Ensure API server is running

2. **Voice Channel Issues**:
   - Run `/setup` to create waiting room
   - Check bot has "Move Members" permission
   - Verify channel names match configuration

3. **Team Creation Fails**:
   - Ensure minimum players in waiting room
   - Check API connectivity
   - Verify database is accessible

4. **Rating Not Updating**:
   - Confirm match result was recorded
   - Check API logs for errors
   - Verify database connection

### Logs and Debugging
- Set `DEBUG=true` in environment for detailed logging
- Check console output for error messages
- Monitor API server logs for database issues

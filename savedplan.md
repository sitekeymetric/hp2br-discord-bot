- **Skill Balance**: Fair rating system for balanced team distribution
- **Region Balance**: Optional region-based player distribution
- **Match Tracking**: Win/loss/draw recording with statistics
- **Database**: SQLite3 with API layer for multi-guild support
- **Voice Management**: Temporary team channels with automated player movement
- **User Experience**: Intuitive UI with timeouts and confirmations

## Phase 1: Database & API Foundation
**Duration**: 3-4 days | **Priority**: Critical

### 1.1 Database Schema Design
- **Users Table**: `guild_id, user_id, username, region_code, skill_rating, games_played, wins, losses, draws, created_at, updated_at`
- **Matches Table**: `match_id, guild_id, match_type, start_time, end_time, status, created_by`
- **Match_Teams Table**: `team_id, match_id, team_name, team_color, avg_skill_rating`
- **Match_Players Table**: `match_id, team_id, user_id, skill_rating_at_time`
- **Match_Results Table**: `match_id, winning_team_id, result_type (win/loss/draw)`

### 1.2 Database API Layer
- **FastAPI or Flask** REST API service
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Endpoints for:
  - User management (create, update skill rating, get stats)
  - Match creation and management
  - Team balancing queries
  - Statistics retrieval
- Guild-based data isolation
- Database connection pooling and error handling

### 1.3 Skill Rating System

- Channel cleanup after game completion

### 5.2 Player Movement System
- **Batch Movement**: Move all players simultaneously

- Handle premature game endings
- Automatic cleanup of abandoned games

**Deliverables**:
- Voice channel creation and management system
- Player movement automation
- Session state management
- Cleanup and error recovery mechanisms

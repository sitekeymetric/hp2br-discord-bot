## 🎯 **System Overview**

### **Before v2.0.0 (Win/Loss System)**

3-Team Match:
Team 1 (1st): WIN → +rating
Team 2 (2nd): LOSS → -rating  ← Same penalty as last place!
Team 3 (3rd): LOSS → -rating
```

```
3-Team Match:
Team 1 (1st): +25.0 rating  ← Champion performance
Team 2 (2nd): +20.8 rating  ← Excellent performance
Team 3 (3rd): +16.7 rating  ← Great performance
```

## 📊 **Rating Scale (Rank 7 = 1500 Baseline)**

### **Complete Rating Table**
```
🏆 Above Baseline (Positive Ratings)
🥇 Rank 1:  +25.0 rating (Champion)
🥈 Rank 2:  +20.8 rating (Excellent)
🥉 Rank 3:  +16.7 rating (Great)
🏆 Rank 4:  +12.5 rating (Very Good)
🏆 Rank 5:  +8.3 rating  (Good)
🏆 Rank 6:  +4.2 rating  (Above Average)
⚖️ Rank 7:  ±0.0 rating  (Baseline - 1500)

📉 Below Baseline (Negative Ratings)
📊 Rank 8:  -1.7 rating  (Slightly Below)
📊 Rank 10: -5.2 rating  (Poor)
📉 Rank 12: -8.7 rating  (Very Bad)
📉 Rank 15: -13.9 rating (Bottom Tier)
🔻 Rank 18: -19.1 rating (Disastrous)
🔻 Rank 20: -22.6 rating (Abysmal)
🔻 Rank 25: -31.3 rating (Rock Bottom)
🔻 Rank 30+: -40.0 rating (Absolute Worst)
```

### **Rating Formula**
```python
def calculate_rating_change(placement, baseline_rank=7, max_rank=30):
    if placement <= baseline_rank:
        # Above baseline: scale from 0 to +25
        if placement == baseline_rank:
            return 0.0
        performance_score = (baseline_rank - placement) / (baseline_rank - 1)
        rating_change = performance_score * 25
    else:
        # Below baseline: scale from 0 to -40
        if placement >= max_rank:
            return -40.0
        performance_score = (placement - baseline_rank) / (max_rank - baseline_rank)
        rating_change = -performance_score * 40
    
    return rating_change
```

### **User Experience**
- **Intuitive Scale**: Rank 7 = 1500 makes sense to users
- **Predictable Changes**: Users know exactly what to expect
- **Encouraging**: Even "losing" teams can gain rating if they place well

### **System Benefits**

## 🎯 **Real-World Examples**

### **Example 1: 3-Team Guild Match**
```
Before (Win/Loss):
Team A (1st): WIN → +30 rating
Team B (2nd): LOSS → -20 rating  ← Unfair!
Team C (3rd): LOSS → -20 rating

After (Placement):
Team A (1st): +25.0 rating ← Deserved champion reward
Team B (2nd): +20.8 rating ← Rewarded for good performance  
Team C (3rd): +16.7 rating ← Still positive for decent showing
```

### **Example 2: Player Rating Journey**
```
Player starts at 1500 rating:

Game 1 - Great performance (2nd place): 1500 → 1521 (+21)
Game 2 - Poor performance (12th place): 1521 → 1512 (-9)
Game 3 - Champion performance (1st place): 1512 → 1537 (+25)
Game 4 - Bad luck game (18th place): 1537 → 1518 (-19)

Result: Net +18 rating over 4 games (fair progression)

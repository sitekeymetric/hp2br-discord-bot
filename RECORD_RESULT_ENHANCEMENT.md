# Enhanced /record_result with Interactive Dialogue (v1.5.0)

## Overview
Completely redesigned the `/record_result` command to use an intuitive interactive dialogue with dropdown selections for each team, replacing the confusing command-line parameters.

## Key Improvements

- **After**: `/record_result` opens an interactive dialogue with dropdowns

### 2. üéØ **Individual Team Selection**
- **Dropdown for each team** with three options:
  - üèÜ **Win** - Team won the match
  - üíî **Loss** - Team lost the match  
  - ü§ù **Draw** - Team drew the match

### 3. ‚úÖ **Smart Validation**
- **Win/Loss validation**: Exactly one team must win, others must lose
- **Draw validation**: If any team draws, all teams must draw
- **Complete selection**: All teams must have a result selected
- **Real-time feedback**: Clear error messages for invalid combinations

### 4. üé® **Enhanced Visual Design**
- **Team composition display**: Shows all players in each team
- **Clear instructions**: Step-by-step guidance

- **Result confirmation**: Beautiful result display with emojis

## User Experience Flow

### New Workflow:
1. **Command**: User types `/record_result`

3. **Selection**: User selects win/loss/draw for each team using dropdowns
4. **Validation**: System validates selections make sense
5. **Submit**: User clicks "Submit Results" button
6. **Confirmation**: Beautiful result display with team outcomes
7. **Cleanup**: Automatic voice channel cleanup and player return

### Visual Example:
```

Team 1          Team 2          Team 3
‚Ä¢ Player1       ‚Ä¢ Player4       ‚Ä¢ Player7
‚Ä¢ Player2       ‚Ä¢ Player5       ‚Ä¢ Player8
‚Ä¢ Player3       ‚Ä¢ Player6       

üìã Instructions

                        [üìù Submit Results]
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **MatchResultView Class**
```python
class MatchResultView(discord.ui.View):
    - Creates dropdown for each team
    - Tracks team results
    - Validates result combinations
    - Handles submission
```

### 2. **TeamResultSelect Dropdown**
```python
class TeamResultSelect(discord.ui.Select):
    - Win/Loss/Draw options with emojis
    - Updates parent view on selection
    - Shows selection in placeholder
```

### 3. **SubmitResultsButton**
```python
class SubmitResultsButton(discord.ui.Button):
    - Disabled until all teams selected
    - Triggers validation and submission
    - Handles database recording
```

### 4. **Smart Validation Logic**
- **Draw scenario**: All teams must have "draw" selected
- **Win/Loss scenario**: Exactly 1 win, rest losses
- **Error handling**: Clear messages for invalid combinations

## Validation Rules

### ‚úÖ **Valid Combinations**
- **Single Winner**: Team 1: Win, Team 2: Loss, Team 3: Loss
- **Draw Match**: Team 1: Draw, Team 2: Draw, Team 3: Draw

### ‚ùå **Invalid Combinations**
- **Multiple Winners**: Team 1: Win, Team 2: Win, Team 3: Loss
- **Mixed Draw**: Team 1: Draw, Team 2: Loss, Team 3: Loss
- **No Winner**: Team 1: Loss, Team 2: Loss, Team 3: Loss
- **Incomplete**: Any team without a selection

## Error Messages

### Clear User Feedback:
- "Please select a result for all teams."
- "If it's a draw, all teams must be marked as 'Draw'."
- "Exactly one team must be marked as 'Win' (others as 'Loss')."
- "All non-winning teams must be marked as 'Loss'."
